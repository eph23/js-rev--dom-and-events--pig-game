# 🐖 Pig Game - JavaScript DOM Project

A fun and interactive dice game where players take turns rolling dice and accumulate points. The game is built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and **DOM Manipulation** as part of my learning journey through the **"Complete JavaScript Course"** by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Two players take turns rolling a dice.
2. Each roll adds to the player's score for the turn.
3. If you roll a **1**, you lose all points accumulated during that turn.
4. You can **hold** your score anytime, saving the points for that turn and passing the turn to the other player.
5. The game continues until a player reaches **100 points**, winning the game.
6. You can **restart** the game anytime by pressing the "New Game" button.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **DOM Manipulation**: How to select, update, and manipulate elements dynamically (e.g., updating the score, changing dice images).
  
- **Event Handling**: Using `addEventListener()` to handle user interactions like button clicks and dice rolls.

- **Game Logic**: Building a simple turn-based game with scoring, risk-taking mechanics, and conditions (e.g., rolling a 1).

- **Randomization**: Generating random dice rolls with `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`.

- **Conditional Statements**: Creating conditions to handle game events like checking if the dice roll is a 1 or if a player has won.

- **CSS Styling with JavaScript**: Changing styles dynamically based on user input (e.g., updating the background color when a player wins).

- **Score Tracking**: Keeping track of the current score and highscore across multiple game rounds.

- **UI/UX Design**: Creating a simple, clean interface with interactive feedback for the user.
